# Achilles
## Prioritizing Vulnerable Dependency Updates through Dependency Graphs
Achilles is a tool that shows a visualization (i.e., using dependency graphs) of both direct and indirect dependencies that are affected by software vulnerabilityattacks. 

## Demo Website
The working prototype of Achilles can be found here: [https://achillestool.com/](https://achillestool.com/)
